Before I start I want to caveat that this setup is mine and may not be something that's right for you.
I have relatively few tasks to manage and my system reflects this.
Maybe this may be a start point, but always be mindful of your personal needs and wants.

I use the following task states in my setup:
- TODO
- DONE
- CANCELED
- WAITING (rarely)
- LATER (very specifically)

I was using DOING before, but I moved away from it as it wasn't working for me.
It just didn't have any added benefit for me.

My tasks generally fall into 3 categories:
- those scheduled for a specific date, either repeating or one-time.
- those belonging to a specific project.
- those that are unscheduled and without project. (Think of these as someday/maybe)
